# Risk Management

## Overview
This document outlines the potential risks associated with the bank website project and the strategies we are using to mitigate them.

## Identified Risks:
1. **Security Breaches**: Given the sensitive nature of user data, security is a primary concern.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement SSL encryption and secure coding practices.

2. **Delays in Development**: Technical challenges or coordination issues could lead to project delays.
   - **Mitigation**: We will have regular check-ins to track progress and address issues early.

3. **Bugs in Code**: Any bugs or glitches could affect the user experience and functionality.
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing will be conducted to identify and fix any issues.

4. **Changing Requirements**: Client requests for additional features could lead to scope creep.
   - **Mitigation**: We will implement a formal change request management process to handle such requests efficiently.
