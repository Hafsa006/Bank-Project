# Change Request Management

## Overview
Changes during the project may occur, and this document outlines how we manage these requests.

## Process for Handling Change Requests:
1. **Logging the Change**: Any request for change will be logged in Trello under a "Change Requests" column to track all incoming requests.
   
2. **Impact Assessment**: The project lead will evaluate how the change affects the timeline, budget, and resources.
   
3. **Approval**: The team will review the proposed change and decide whether to approve or reject it.

4. **Version Control**: Any approved change will be tracked through GitHub using commits for transparency.

5. **Testing**: After the change has been implemented, the team will test the new feature to ensure it functions correctly and doesnâ€™t introduce new bugs.
